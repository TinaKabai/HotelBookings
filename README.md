<h6>The problem domain I have identified and decided to work on is a Hotel booking system that will allow the guests to be able book the hotel rooms on their own from a hotel system.</h6>

<p>Usually when guests go on a vacation or are on a business trip they want to arrive at places they will feel completely comfortable with and also be in rooms of their choice with the perfect view to make them feel at home. When the room is booked by the hotel, guests tend to have so many complaints about not having what they expected or sometimes getting the rooms they did not book for. Now, the system I am going to build will solve all that by giving the guests the platform to make bookings themselves up to the final stage. When a guest booked a room, the system will block it from being available to other guests.</p>
<p>After the booking is done, the room will be booked for 3 days before payment. If the payment is not submitted within 3 days of the booking, the room will be removed from the booked list and be available to other guests. This system will allow the guests to be able to view the booked as well as the available rooms. This is advantageous to guests so they could see the locations of the rooms as they will likely want to know the rooms they chose will be on which side of the building, which floor and also the view they might have. The pictures of each room will also be displayed next to room numbers on the booking system. This will solve the quarrel the guests normally have about knowing the room numbers only, but not the whole feel of the room beforehand.</p>
<p>This system will benefit everyone and save time for the hotel HR for booking rooms and trying to explain how the room looks like instead of them actually seeing it. The guests will also have enough time to go through the rooms by looking at pictures of each to conclude that indeed their price are very reasonable.</p>
